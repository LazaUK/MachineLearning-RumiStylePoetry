# Auto-generating poetry in Rumi-style

Jalaluddin Muhammad RumÄ« is a 13th-century Persian poet, scholar and Sufi mystic. Here I train RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) model on some of Rumi's poems to apply then the learnt style to produce new "poetry" text.

Input dataset with 88 Rumi poems translated by Nader Khalili was donwloaded from this [Kaggle source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hskhawaja/poems-by-rumi).
